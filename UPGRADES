Here, we will use books and "realms" (i.e. Challenges) to essentially "Upgrade" and get closer to 0day hunting and exploitation.
Below you will see "Bounded" and "Unbounded" realms. Bounded just refers to skills and knowledge that is bounded to the books provided while Unbounded involves using that knowledge to test and challenge yourself.
