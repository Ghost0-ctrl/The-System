# The-System
In this System, you, the player, have all the resources you need to become among the elite. It is filled with material to ultimately make a newbie into an Exploit Developer - Good Luck.

                                                              *   *   *
                                        
This realm is intended to provide all the necessary course material, books, podcasts, tutorials, etc, needed to help the aspiring hacker achieve his/her goal of Zero Day Exploitation. 
There will be some cool missions, quests, skill acquisitions, title acquisitions and more. The important note here is to enjoy the ride and not focus too heavily on the end goal as that is probably still far away. 

                                                              *   *   *
                                        
In this system, you are the player known as the ‚ÄúMonarch of Shadows‚Äù. You, however, are not fit to carry that title with your current strength and power. Hence The System is set and designed to ensure your growth and progression in order to reach that power. Chin up, shoulders back, dive in and focus everyday. Your goal is simple, accumulate more chrono fragments and exp.

"In the void between data and destruction, only the sharpened mind carves its path through the abyss."

Currency:üîπ*Chrono Fragments* (Time Invested)

*"Power is measured in the hours bled into the void."*

  - Each hour studied = **1 Chrono Fragment**
  - You can **spend** Chrono Fragments on different upgrades, unlocks, or rewards

### **ü©∏ Blood Bar ‚Äì Burnout Prevention**

Just like in games, if you **push too hard, you die (mentally).** To avoid this:
   
  - Set a **Health Bar (HP)** in Notion, starting at **100 HP.**
  - **Every hour spent hacking drains 5 HP.**
  - **Restoring HP:**
    - **Breaks (15-30 min)** ‚Üí +10 HP
    - **Exercise (Workout, Walk, etc.)** ‚Üí +20 HP
    - **Sleep (7+ hours)** ‚Üí +50 HP
      
**üî• HP at 0?** ‚Üí You enter **Overheat Mode**, where your CF rewards **halve** until you restore your HP.


                                                              *   *   *

# How EXP Works

### **Chrono Mastery EXP System ‚Äì Level Up Your 0DED Progression!** üéÆüî•
## **1. How EXP Works**
  - **1 Chrono Fragment (CF) = 10 EXP**
  - **Each level requires EXP based on this formula:**
    - **Level 1 ‚Üí 100 EXP**
    - **Level 2 ‚Üí 200 EXP**
    - **Level 3 ‚Üí 300 EXP**
    - **Level 4 ‚Üí 500 EXP**
    - **Level 5+ ‚Üí 1,000 EXP per level***(The further you go, the harder it gets to level up, simulating skill mastery.)*

---

## **2. Tracking EXP & Levels**
Add these properties in your Notion database:
  1. **Chrono Fragments (CF)** (Number) ‚Äì Track total CF earned
  2. **EXP Gained** (Number) ‚Äì Manually update EXP (1 CF = 10 EXP)
  3. **Level** (Number) ‚Äì Manually increase when hitting the EXP threshold
  4. **Level Title** (Multi-select) ‚Äì Choose from a list of titles earned
  5. **Rewards & Unlocks** (Text) ‚Äì Write down what you unlock at each level

## **4. How to Use It**

1. After each study session (i.e. 1 hour), add **Chrono Fragments (CF)** earned.
2. Multiply **CF x 10** to get your **EXP Gained**.
3. When EXP reaches the next threshold, manually **increase your Level**.
4. Update your **Level Title** and write down the **Rewards / Unlocks**.

---

## **5. Optional: Side Quests for Bonus EXP**
To make it more interactive, you can earn **Bonus EXP** from **special quests**:

---

## **6. Alternative: Progress Bar (Manual Update)**
If you want a **visual EXP bar**, you can create a **progress bar** manually:
  1. Add an **EXP Progress (Number)** property.
  2. Set the formula:
    - **(Current EXP / Next Level EXP) * 100**
    - Example: If you have **150/200 EXP**, your progress would be **(150/200) * 100 = 75%**
  3. Display this as a **progress bar** in Notion‚Äôs ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù view.
